# Hi there, I'm Khalid Hossain Badhon 👋

## 🌟 About Me  
I’m a Front‑End Engineer at ScaleUp Ads Agency with a strong track record of building and leading frontend teams. I specialize in React / Next.js / Inertia.js projects, and I enjoy solving complex UI/UX problems and optimizing performance across devices.  

Currently, I’m focusing on:  
- Converting legacy codebases (e.g., from Next.js TypeScript to Inertia.js React + JavaScript)  
- Improving performance: lazy loading, caching, smooth scrolling & carousels  
- Building multilingual e-commerce applications with robust internationalization  

I value clean, maintainable code and practical solutions — delivering high quality UI while keeping the structure maintainable and scalable.

## 🛠️ Stack & Tech Skills  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, React, Next.js, Inertia.js, HTML, CSS/SASS, SVG / CSS animations  
- **Backend / Full‑Stack:** Node.js / MERN stack (for projects where I handle full‑stack work)  
- **Other tools:** Stripe integration, performance optimization (lazy loading, caching), multilingual support (i18n), responsive design, version control (Git)  
- **Workflow / Methodologies:** Component‑based architecture, modular code, team collaboration and code reviews

## 🎯 What I’m Working On / Interested In  
- Building and maintaining a dynamic multilingual e-commerce site (multi‑language support includes Spanish, English, Thai, German, Japanese, French, Italian, Chinese, Portuguese, Hindi, Russian)  
- Enhancing performance and user experience: lazy loading images/videos, fixing carousel flickers, improving caching & asynchronous content rendering  
- Developing feature-rich interactive UIs like animated SVG text, chat panels, mobile-responsive modals  
- Learning & exploring advanced web performance optimization and full‑stack web architecture

## 💡 Projects & Highlights  
*(Replace the placeholders with your actual repo/project links and descriptions.)*  

### [Project 1 — eCommerce Multilingual Platform](#)  
A full-featured e-commerce platform supporting multiple languages (EN, ES, TH, DE, JP, FR, IT, ZH, PT, HI, RU), built with React / Next.js / Inertia.js. Includes optimized image/video lazy loading, i18n routing based on URL paths (e.g. `/shop/:category/:subcategory`), and high-performance caching.

### [Project 2 — Animated SVG / UI Experiments](#)  
Converted vanilla JS SVG‑text animation to work in Next.js 14. Great for showcasing interactive UI features and front-end animation skills.

### [Project 3 — Frontend Performance Enhancements & Refactoring](#)  
Refactored legacy codebases, improved lazy-loading, fixed flickering issues in carousels, and optimized rendering flows for better user experience across devices.
